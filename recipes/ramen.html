        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 chicken breasts (boneless, skin-on)*
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper, to season</li>
            <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tsp sesame or vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the chicken*: Preheat the oven to 375â„‰. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil until ready to serve.
